# rpg-clicker-game

Hi! If you're not me (and this should be a fairly easy question), thanks for stopping by! I hope you're here to check out what I'm doing, and not just steal all of my work; not that there's a whole lot to steal.

My goal is to sharpen my web development skills, while simultaneously working on a personal project. 

This [will eventually be] an incremental style game, where game mechanics unfold as you progress. Notable examples of incremental games include games like A Dark Room, or Cookie Clicker. Players will click to initiate combat, and kill monsters will various learned skills in order to gain money (Mun) and experience (XP) to buy new items and level up their characters in order to become more powerful.
